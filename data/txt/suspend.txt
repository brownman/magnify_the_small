jump up - try to reach higher
sit straight - and open your ears
where is your pillow for your back ?
ting - and do it whenever you choose
none of us have doubts 
do something exciting - and do it whenever you choose
can jump and run - and never reach his goal - stop for a minute and think
look around with your neck and take a deep breath
did I do it so good
move your spine and cry
sit and only than - do it on the best side
sit and only than - do it on the best side
I am not an animal
I'm a human being
close your eyes and scream - but do it silently
yeah - I can do it
look around with your neck and take a deep breath
look around with your neck and take a deep breath
