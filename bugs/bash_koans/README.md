# Bash Koans

So I set up to learn Bash better. Normally I try to learn by doing koans, but I could not find any, so I decided to learn by building koans for Bash.

## DISCLAIMER

I am no Bash expert. This is a project strictly for learning and fun. It's also not complete, I'm doing this when I have a moment.

If you are an expert, PLEASE contribute and make it even better!

### How to

Just clone this repo and run:

    ./meditate
