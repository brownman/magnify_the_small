    - one upon a time there was a little child
    - and he had to give back a sum of 1 million dollar - atleast that is what he thought
    - so he sat beside his piles of papers and he was shaking from fear
    - at last he gather a deep breath and open his notebook
    - he was supprise - very very much 
    - he just couldn't believe was he saw
    - it was a dream, a dream which came true
