Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create an installation package for a Linux
distribution (Debian based, or RHEL compatible). The information you use and the process itself
are of equal importance for us as the end result. Please document your steps, including what you've
searched for and the results you found useful to complete the task. You're welcome to use whatever
sources you find as long as you create the end result yourself.
Beside the documentation of your steps, please provide the following for each task:
1. binary result (deb or rpm file)
2. source package
3. reproduction instructions
Tasks:
1. Package ssh2 PECL extension version 0.12 for a Linux distribution. The package should be
installable and the extension should load whenever PHP is used (e.g. CLI). Bonus if both
deb and RPM are provided.
2. The ssh2 PECL extension got a few bugs fixed in it's source control system, not yet release.
Generate a patch for one of these fixes based on version 0.12 and apply it during the build of
another set of package(s) as in the previous task.
Good luck,
Linux integration team
