TEST


PART 1

In CoffeeScript write these:
A function that iterates between 1 and 1000, for numbers dividing by 3 it prints "Swifto", by 5 it prints "loves dogs" and for both it prints "Swifto loves dogs". It prints the number itself for all other numbers.
A function that takes 2 strings and checks if they have the same letters and the same amount of appearances per letter. for example: "cabba" and "ababc" will return true but "abaa" and "bbba" wont
Create classes that resemble a blog post page and its comments.

You can learn the language here coffeescript.org
Use http://jsfiddle.net/ (in panels on the left, choose coffeescript over javascript) to run the code, save it and send it to me for testing.

 PART 2

- ad that needed to be inserted in document.write - how to speed it?

- how to track clicks on a website? how to track different locations in the same article? can you do it w/o dirty your URL?

- how to save a lot of info in client-side?

- I want to write instead of this code:
for (var i=0;i<someArray.length;i++) {
  var item=someArray[i];
  alert(item);
}
 this code - is it better? in what? is there a problem with it? when I can use the new code? 
for (var i=0,item;item=someArray[i];i++) {
  alert(item);
}

- I want to have auto-complete in my website - how do you recommend to do it? describe the alternatives - when and why you chose every options?

- this is my schema
authors
- id
- user_id
users
- id

 I want to have all the user nicks that contain the prefix "Dr." in it and get them as one string (named nicks) with commas between nicks.
 I want to add "author_id" field to users table and I want to fill this field with the ids of the authors (when user_id = users.id).

- I got this error "Access to restricted URI denied" when I tried to run ajax call to a third-party server. What can I do to solve it?
