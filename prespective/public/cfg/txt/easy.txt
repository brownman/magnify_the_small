to ask Tom for help
feel good
it is easy to do something good for other person
to smile to myself and to the world
multi
I am having a lot of fun
to be nice to another person
to learn physics
to laugth loudly
if you work slowly - you will climb up quickly
to be optimic and to wish for more happiness
I like to do things in my kind of way
to create list of priority level - and to follow it
to hope and to pray for more joy
there is a reason for everything
I like this place - it is cozy and warm
it is easy to feel good
to keep in touch with my friends
it is easy to look on the bright side of life
to look on the blue sky
to be crazy and to mimic animal's behaviour
to say - I am very good at what I am doing
to be practical and fast
the sun is shining and the birds are singing
to fly above the clouds
to work on myself - and say to myself - you are the best
I am so talented
that the fish live in the water and can actually breath there
grow up to be a good physicition
it possible to be happy after all
to drive and listen to a lecture
to breath deeply
 
start my day with a smile
